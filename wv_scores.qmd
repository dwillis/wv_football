Calculate the average differential by year for WV games

```{r}

  group_by(year) |> 
  summarise(
    avg_diff = mean(differential),
    median_diff = median(differential)

    subtitle = "Average margin of victory is more than 30 points this season",
    x="Year", 
    y="Average Difference"

```

## Are there more 40+ margin games?

```{r}
all_games <- wv_games |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarise(all_games = n())

forty_plus <- wv_games |>

forty_with_pct <- all_games |>

  mutate(pct = forty_plus_games/all_games *100) |> 
  arrange(desc(pct))
