## West Virginia High School Football Scores

This repository contains a scraper for high school football games published by http://wvtailgatecentral.com/. It determines, where possible, the home and visiting teams, assigns a state to each team and calculates the absolute value of the score differential, then writes that all out to a CSV file.

The data includes games from 2009-forward, with one exception: 2017 games are not available on the site.
